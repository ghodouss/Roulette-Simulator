# Roulette-Simulator
My interpretation of the textbook "Building Skills in Object Oriented Design."
http://buildingskills.itmaybeahack.com/oodesign.html

Using clean, object-oriented design, I developed a roulette simulator
that runs simulations and analyses of various popular roulette strategies
in order to reccomend the optimal strategy given a player and a table's
unique parameters.
